I spend a lot of time trying to learn hard mathematical things, across a variety of subjects. I love that eureka sensation, when the concept suddenly becomes intuitive, and I can start applying it with confidence right away.

<!-- TODO include a short example to make this concrete. Maybe stick with the example throughout. What's an example of something hard that I learned recently? Probably some eigenvector stuff...-->

I've discovered some strategies that really help! 

# When the first explanation doesn't click

I see three closely related factors in the cost of learning something:
1. It's embarrassing to feel yourself fail to understand something
2. To judge whether an explanation is likely to click, you first have to mentally engage with it
3. The further you have to look in your list of candidate explanations, the longer it's going to take you to find that right explanation

So suppose you google "Kullback-Leibler divergence" and you don't understand the first explanation. 
* you feel frustrated, maybe even ashamed that you didn't "get" the first explanation
* you grow more discouraged about your odds of success with each failed explanation
* you know successive explanations are less likely to click, so you engage less with each one, further lowering their odds of success

<!-- TODO for #3, it would help to have a graph of perceived probability of success - show how it gets more flat the further you go to the right -->
I think this is a special case of a very fundamental epistemological issue which keeps me up at night: it's very hard to reason about knowledge you don't have!

# Strategies
* Find a really short one
* * A short explanation costs so little attention that you are less hesitant to pay attention
* * Gives you an idea of what future explanations might look like. Easier to digest future explanations
* Use something like wordstotime.com to estimate the amount of attention required
* Take notes on several sheets of scratch paper. Let these notes be sloppy, too. It just extends your working memory temporarily, feel free to scrap it as soon as you're done.


Searching `intuitive + {query of interest}` on an appropriate stackexchange website, and filtering by minimum score. [Here’s an example search](https://math.stackexchange.com/search?q=intuitive+singular+value+decomposition+score%3A100). 

If I find a super high-level wikipedia article on something *extremely* fundamental, it behooves me to replace en.wikipedia.org → simple.wikipedia.org and read that simplified explanation before the full article. Because the simplified text is so much smaller than the full article, it doesn't add much time. But it can help you realize what parts of the full text can simply be skipped. 

3Blue1Brown is unparalleled. Communicating math with colorful animations extends the cognitive dimensions of notation. Your brain has a module for visual-spatial intuition.

# Unreasonably effective strategies for good explanations
* Liberal use of formatting!
* * Bullet points, headings are secondary notation
* * This reduces the cognitive load on the reader
* Draw pictures! 
* Examples!
