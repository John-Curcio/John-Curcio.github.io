# README

For future John: read [this](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) for testing and making updates to this site

Also [this](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) for a review on how to host a Hugo site on GitHub Pages

Start Hugoâ€™s development server and view the site at the URL displayed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:1313/)
```
hugo server --buildDrafts
hugo server -D
```

Add a new draft page to the site:
```
hugo new blog/yet-another-post.md
```
