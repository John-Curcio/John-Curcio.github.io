But really, English is <em>really bad</em>.</p><p>Have you ever tried to describe a set of physical instructions to someone, and utterly failed to get your point across? I&rsquo;ve experienced this as the instructor, the student, and an innocent bystander, in the contexts of proper bench press form, Brazilian jiujitsu, and assembling furniture. I don&rsquo;t think this is because any parties involved were exceptionally dumb - it&rsquo;s the English language&rsquo;s fault.</p><p>When two people view an object from different angles, there is the potential for ambiguity when a person says &ldquo;up&rdquo;, &ldquo;left&rdquo;, or &ldquo;forward&rdquo;. So people invented words for absolute coordinate systems, like &ldquo;starboard&rdquo;, &ldquo;yaw&rdquo;, &ldquo;proper left&rdquo;, and cardinal directions.</p><p><strong>Idioms represent patterns that English speakers as a society have selected to be frequent and important enough to be worth collectively memorizing, despite being difficult to articulate in standard English.</strong> The idea is mapped onto the context domain by analogy. A hundred years from now, our most popular idioms may be streamlined down to words. The words we know and love were probably once idioms, and clumsy analogies before that.</p><h1 id=the-pitch>The pitch</h1><p>What are some other ideas that are hard to express in standard English?</p><p>It&rsquo;s difficult to generate examples, because in order to think of them, you usually have to be able to express them in language (an embarrassing amount of our thought happens in the form of language). And ipso facto, we&rsquo;re talking about the set of things that are hard to express in English.</p><p><strong>You should be curious about the thoughts you currently can&rsquo;t have, and furious that you can&rsquo;t yet think them.</strong></p><p>Coming up with these kinds of good words gives you a way to memoize certain complex, difficult-to-articulate concepts. You&rsquo;re confident that you can apply the pattern to new domains and explain it deeply if necessary, but you don&rsquo;t have to re-derive it every time. This creates slack in your working memory for other things, allowing you to reach hitherto-unexplored regions of thought-space.</p><h1 id=concrete-advice>Concrete advice</h1><ol><li>You want to find ideas which are easy enough to explain, and recognized as legitimate, but that others would be unlikely to generate, let alone apply.</li><li>I&rsquo;ve found that very fundamental words from mathematical or scientific disciplines are unreasonably effective, especially given the simplicity of the underlying idea. It&rsquo;s very easy to make them intuitive, and they&rsquo;ve been selected to be the basis for entire fields. Consider the word &ldquo;orthogonal&rdquo;: it&rsquo;s basically a new preposition!</li><li>Ideas with names that include the word &ldquo;paradox&rdquo; are also unreasonably effective. These things have been selected to be unintuitive, yet true. If you can learn the idea, to the point where you can explain it confidently to a layman, and you know it in your bones to be true, then that idea becomes a new basis vector that extends your intuition-space.</li></ol><p>Yes, this makes you weird. And from the outside, weird things are often adversely selected. But it gives you a way of understanding the world that is very difficult for others to replicate. If you&rsquo;re smarter than average, your risk of being wrong is lower anyway.</p><p>When you hear people say &ldquo;I guess I never thought about it that way&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s working.</p><h1 id=precedent>Precedent</h1><p>This is an extremely common pattern among smart, curious, productive people. It also makes you fun to talk to.</p><ul><li><a href=https://matt-rickard.com/erdos-vocab>Paul Erd√∂s</a>, a mathematician known for his sheer productivity</li><li><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html#:~:text=Several%20friends%20mentioned,shrinks%20the%20court.">Paul Graham</a></li><li><a href=https://roonscape.substack.com/p/a-song-of-shapes-and-words>roon</a></li></ul><p>I found the following quote by Alfred North Whitehead worth committing to memory:</p><blockquote><p>It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them. Operations of thought are like cavalry charges in a battle ‚Äî they are strictly limited in number, they require fresh horses, and must only be made at decisive moments.</p></blockquote></content><p></p></main><footer>Made with <a href=https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/>Hugo  ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î Bear</a></footer></body></html>
