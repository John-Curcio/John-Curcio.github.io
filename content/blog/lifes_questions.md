A friend pointed out recently that we appear to have made shockingly little progress around even the most basic questions about life. Why do we exist? What's the nature of our world, our minds, consciousness? What happens after we die?

These "woah dude" types of thoughts usually annoy people, but everyone has assumptions around these things, and these often-unexamined beliefs form the foundation of our worldview and identity.

Ironically I think the "what is my purpose" question would have been much more readily answered if we were hunter-gatherer cavemen beset on all sides by nature and beasts. It would simply be something like "to serve my tribe, friends and family. Bringing home meat and inventing tools keeps us fat, happy, and healthy."

Here are some questions which they probably would have spent their time pondering instead:

1. "What causes illness and how can we cure it?"
2. "What are the millions of shining white things that appear in the sky every night? Why do they change in pattern slightly every night? Why do some really bright ones move around, and others stay put? And whatâ€™s up with the sun randomly turning black every now and then?" Before light pollution, the night sky would have been beautiful, so this one must have been really tantalizing.

We've done a pretty good job of answering all the major questions that a caveman could possibly come up with, so naturally the ones that are left have been selected to be head scratchers. But we may actually find answers to these questions one day. Given that we've been unsuccessful for thousands of years, it'll probably be thousands of years more before we get the answers.
