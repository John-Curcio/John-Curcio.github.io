I'm John Curcio, and this is my blog. I like weird little math problems and real data.

I'm always writing an essay or hacking on some bizarre side project, and every now and then I share what I'm working on.

Here's what I hope to write about:
* Finding alpha in sports betting on mixed martial arts fights
* Messing around with GPT-3, cherry-picking remarkable results
* Explanations I've written for compex topics, which are worth caching
* Analysis of weird datasets I've gathered
* Surprisingly interesting Wikipedia articles
* Unreasonably useful words
