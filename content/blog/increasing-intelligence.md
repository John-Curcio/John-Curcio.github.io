The consensus opinion on the topic of intelligence is that by the time you're an adult, you probably can't change it. 

I claim that everyone is wrong about this. There are a million ways to make yourself smarter, for all intents and purposes. Here are some of them.

# Why does everyone think this is extremely difficult?
1. It's not worth investigating. Intelligence is only one factor for having good ideas.
2. There are many kinds of intelligence that matter, some of which are difficult to measure, let alone optimize.
3. The algernon argument: if it were possible to augment your intelligence, why have we not already evolved to be that way?
4. No free lunch: easy interventions are quickly adopted.

A bit of speculation:
* I think people are afraid of signaling that they're stupid. If you adopt practices that might make yourself smarter, you signal to others that you need them in the first place. This is a rational fear!
* If you find a case where you are surprised by your own stupidity, you should be delighted. You've just discovered a set of apparently simple thoughts which you can't think! What might happen if such thoughts suddenly became intuitive?
* It is extremely difficult to tell from the inside whether you have gotten smarter or not. Sensation is a bad predictor of performance.

# Practices
* Smart people have idiosyncratic vocabularies. 
* Think through writing.

# Biology, anatomy
* Lying down. Blood reaches your brain more easily.
* Close your eyes to visualize things better
* Don't listen to music - use earplugs
